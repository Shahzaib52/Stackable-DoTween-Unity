# Stackable-DoTween-Unity

*REQUIRES DOTWEEN [FREE/PAID]*

If you are like me who prefer seeing stuff happening in the Unity inspector and wants control over how it's being happened without delving into the code, then this repo is for you.

As the name suggests, this handy utility helps you run multiple tweens on an object without having you to dive into the code.

I have tried to keep the code as much clean and readable as possible so anyone can easily understand the code and expand the funtionality to fit their need.
comes bundled with 4 commonly used tweens that you can just add as components on a gameobject and tweak with parameters to get desired results.

check the sample scene under /tween utility/scenes/sample scene to see how things are put together.
please feel free to reach out to me in case you have any questions or need help setting it up.

best,
Shahzaib
